    <h2>
        The Reporting API security is a combination of SSL encryption, activation, a unique site code 
        and credentials.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Even though SSL is not required, TimeLog highly recommends it for all interactions with the API.
        Each method in the Reporting API needs to be explicitly enabled in the TimeLog System
        Administration by a user with the appropriate system administrator privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each TimeLog site has its own unique SiteCode required on all requests. You may request
        a the SiteCode from the System Administration inside TimeLog, or request it directly
        at <a href="mailto:support@timelog.com">support@timelog.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional, each TimeLog site can define one set of Reporting API credentials that are
        also required for each request.
