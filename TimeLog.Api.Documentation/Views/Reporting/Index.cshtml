    <h1>Introduction to the Reporting API</h1>

    <p>
        The Reporting API is based on standard web technologies, web services and XML.
        Use the Reporting API to extract from TimeLog into intranets, extranets,
        business reporting tools, applications etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea behind the Reporting API is to give access to as much of the TimeLog
        Project data models as possible in a easy to use XML format. The origin of the
        API goes way back in the history of TimeLog, so we will extend on it on
        a per-request basis for new fields and data types. Please get in touch, if you
        think we lack some information in the various methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be aware that no security policies on user access will be applied to any of the
        methods in the Reporting API. The Reporting API is for flat data extractions.
        Take care to apply your own policies if you are exposing the data in a data
        warehouse or other business intelligence tools.
    </p>

    <h2 id="status-codes">Status codes</h2>
    <p>
        The reporting will (starting from end May 2021) return specific HTTP 
        status codes related to the result. The result body will remain unchanged and will
        in many cases provide additional information. Possible status responses:
    </p>
    <ul class="arrows">
        <li>200 OK - request successful</li>
        <li>204 No Content - the result of the request is empty</li>
        <li>400 Bad Request - covers both issues with input parameters, but possibly also internal errors</li>
        <li>401 Unauthorized - the Site ID, API ID and API password combination is invalid</li>
    </ul>
