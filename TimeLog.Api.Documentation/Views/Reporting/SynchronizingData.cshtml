    <h2>
        With the reporting API you are able to synchronize most of the TimeLog data objects into your
        data warehouse or similar for further processing.
    </h2>
    <p>
        This page will guide you through the basic setup for a single TimeLog resource. In order to generate
        more comprehensive reports based on more TimeLog resources, we recommend that you find a consultant
        with expertise in Microsoft Power BI.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to replicate TimeLog data (specifically time registrations) to your data warehouse or similar
        we recommend the following procedure to ensure consistent data without heavy API usage:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="icon-arrow_in_circle">Every quarter fetch and sync the full data set in batches by month</li>
        <li class="icon-arrow_in_circle">Every month fetch and sync the last 3 months of data</li>
        <li class="icon-arrow_in_circle">Every week fetch and sync the last 4 weeks of data</li>
        <li class="icon-arrow_in_circle">Every day fetch and sync the last 7 days of data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that you might need to adjust the intervals and periods to fit the data discipline in your TimeLog instance.</p>

    <h3 id="usage"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h3>
    
    <p>
        We continuously monitor API usage and usage patterns to avoid single customers causing heavy load and
        degraded performance for other customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, we do not have hard limits.
    </p>
    <p>
        We encourage our customers and their partners to use our API responsibly. We will reach out to the 
        employee tagged as "TimeLog Responsible" within the system before taking actions that limits the use
        of the API.
    </p>

    <h3 id="alternative-for-time-registrations"><a href="#alternative-for-time-registrations">Alternative for time registrations</a></h3>
    <p>
        Another possibility for synchronization of time registrations is to use the <em>GetWorkChangesPaged</em>-method within the
        latest <em>ProjectManagementService</em> in the <a href="@Url.Action("Services", "Transactional")">transactional API</a>.
