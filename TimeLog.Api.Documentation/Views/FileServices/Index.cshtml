        TimeLog has various file export features inside the UI and the idea is to 
        make them available via an API.
    </h2>
    <p>
        These file services are proof-of-concept and work in progress APIs. Do not expect
        updates, so you should get in contact with us in order to hear more about additional
        services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the file services API to fetch files automatically that normally only are available
        for users inside TimeLog.
