    <h2>Swagger Documentation is an API documentation that is automatically generated from our application.</h2>
    <p>
        In our Swagger Documentation, you can easily find all the methods that you can use, along with details about how to use them.
    </p>
    <h3>URL to access Swagger Documentation</h3>
    <p>
        https://app[x].timelog.com/[account name]/api/docs/ui/index
    </p>
    <p>
        Take note of your TimeLog URL in the browser. In most cases, it would follow the pattern below.
        [X] is replaced by a number and the [account name] is the same you use for login.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your TimeLog URL in the browser is https://app.timelog.com, you may retrieve your specific
        TimeLog URL in <strong>System Administration</strong>,
        then <strong>Integrations and API</strong> then <strong>Transactional API settings</strong>.
        You should see a URL with a similar pattern as above, in the section <strong>Your TImeLog API URL</strong>.
