    <h1>Handling External Systems</h1>
    <h2>
        TimeLog allows integrations to store foreign keys from other systems together with
        the normal data from TimeLog.
    </h2>
    <p>
        TimeLog API was made with integration purpose in mind. Often when two or more business 
        systems are integrated, the first part of the integration is to synchronize the two systems 
        customer base. Keeping a customer base synchronized through more than two systems can be a 
        nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
        For many of the objects available through the API, you have access to a ExternalKeys-property.
        This property is populated and can be populated with an external system and external key pair
        for tracking foreign keys in a third party system. For a system integrator, this engine allows
        TimeLog to be a hub for the foreign key relationship between multiple systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        E.g. the TimeLog e-conomic integration internally uses these external key constructs to
        keep track of the foreign key from e-conomic after transferring customers, contacts and
        invoices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, some of our APIs support direct requests by external keys to get TimeLog
        objects related to an external system key. The keys are interpreted as strings and can
        essentially be any object type that can be turned into a string.
